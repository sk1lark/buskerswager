Here's why:
* It differentiates between switching a scene and script
* It counts key presses as coding and mouse clicks as building scene
* Changing scene structure results in a heartbeat sent
* It correctly detects OS, machine name, language, editor, files
* It can detect your cursor line and position
* Time is split between: Building, Coding, Testing
* In the future it will also detect testing your projects

It works on both Linux and Windows, it wasn't tested on macOS yet
